Extract structured scam intelligence from the conversation.

Look for and extract:
- UPI IDs (format: username@bankname or phone@upi)
- Bank account numbers (typically 9-18 digits)
- IFSC codes (format: 4 letters + 7 alphanumeric, e.g., SBIN0001234)
- URLs (any web links including shortened URLs)
- Phone numbers (with or without country code)

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "upi_ids": ["extracted upi ids or empty array"],
  "bank_accounts": ["extracted account numbers or empty array"],
  "ifsc_codes": ["extracted ifsc codes or empty array"],
  "urls": ["extracted urls or empty array"],
  "phones": ["extracted phone numbers or empty array"]
}

Important:
- Extract ALL occurrences found in the conversation
- Normalize phone numbers (remove spaces, keep country code if present)
- Include full URLs without modifications
- Do not include duplicates in the arrays
- If nothing is found for a category, return an empty array []

Do not include any explanation or additional text. Only the JSON object.
